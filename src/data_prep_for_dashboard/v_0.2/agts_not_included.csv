This is why the Union, while searching for a global solution to the problems of the former Yugoslavia, is of the opinion that the following priorities are essential:
...
- a solution for Bosnia Herzegovina based on the ""Geneva package"";

Page 1, I. Humanitarian Aid, A. Implementation of Joint Action
1) The Presidency has given a first report to the Ministers, following its contacts with UNHCR and UNPROFOR, on the choice of privileged itineraries (see attachment). The choice of the itinerary will be left to the organisations in charge of the delivery of aid in consulatation with UNPROFOR and this in function of the military situation, agreements concluded in the field, the climate and the condition of the routes.

Page 2, II. Action Plan for a political solution, A.A negotiated solution for BiH
1. The Council believes that the parties must look for a negotiated settlement based on the acquis of Geneva, as was finalised on H.M.S. Invincible on 20 September. 

Page 3, II. Action Plan for a political solution, B. Situation in the Croatian territories under UNPROFOR mandate.
The European Union is perfectly aware of the validity of the claims of Croatia and of the support that it is entitled to expect from the international community for the full implementation of the Vance Plan. For lack of a rapid final solution, the European Union will concentrate on the adoption of a modus vivendi comprising a ceasefire and confidence-building measures in conformity with Resolution 847 of the Security Council.
