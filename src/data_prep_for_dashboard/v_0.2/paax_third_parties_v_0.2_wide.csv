The Group noted such positive developments as the appointment of the members of the Interim Elections Commission and the ad hoc Supreme Court, the completion of reconnaissance visits by ECOMOG to the areas held by the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), and the opening of some of the trunk roads in Liberia. However, many other important aspects of the Yamoussoukro Accord had remained unimplemented, particularly those relating to the establishment of a buffer zone along the Sierra Leone-Liberia border, and the encampment and disarmament of all combatants.

Page 1, Outcome of Deliberations, Reaffirmation of the Yamoussoukro Accord, 4: The Group's discussion was characterised by a new spirit of constructive dialogue. The Group reaffirmed the validity of the Yamoussoukro Accord of 30 October 1991 as offering the best possible framework for a peaceful resolution of the Liberian conflict, for creating the necessary conditions of peace and security and the proper atmosphere that would conduct free, fair and democratic elections in Liberia. It therefore called on all the parties concerned, in particular the NPFL, to repose trust and confidence in ECOMOG and to co-operate fully with ECOMOG to ensure, without any further delay, the speedy, uninterrupted and effective implementation of the Accord.

Page 2, Outcome of Deliberations, Reaffirmation of the Yamoussoukro Accord, 5: The Group requested the parties to refrain from any act or omission that might be prejudicial to the implementation of the Accord; the meeting agreed to make the following clarifications:
...(c) That the encampment and disarmament of all combatants shall be carried out by ECOMOG as envisioned in the Yamoussoukro Accord.

P.

I am pleased to report that peace talks between the Seven Party Alliance forming the Government of Nepal and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) led to the successful conclusion of an important agreement on 8 November 2006, which has now been  consolidated  by  a  Comprehensive  Peace  Agreement,  signed  on 21 November 2006. Earlier this year, following receipt of the identical letters of 9 August 2006 from the Government and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), I appointed Ian Martin as my Personal Representative to undertake consultations with all concerned parties in order to build on the common understanding that had emerged. The agreement of 8 November 2006 represents an important milestone outlining the next steps in the political process leading to free and fair elections for a Constituent Assembly in 2007. In that agreement, the parties have agreed on the basic arrangements for the cantonment of the combatants of the Maoist People’s Liberation Army and the storage of the arms and munitions of both sides. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement declares the commitment of the parties to transform the existing ceasefire into permanent peace.

Page 1, I. DECLARATION OF THE PARTIES
3. Accordingly, the Parties agree that the powers and authorities of the United Nations during the transitional period, as described in the settlement plan, and during the referendum campaign, as described in the code of conduct, shall apply to ensure, among other things, that there shall be complete freedom of speech and assembly, and of the press, as well as freedom of movement of personnel and property into, out of and within the Territory, thus creating a climate of public tranquillity within which a referendum free of all constraints, intimidation and harassment can be organized and conducted by the United Nations.

... Whereas in the Oslo Agreement of 30 March 1990, the delegation of the National Reconciliation Commission of Guatemala (CNR), acting with the full support of the Government of Guatemala, and the delegation of the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG), acting with the full support of its General Command, placed on record their express determination to find ways to solve the nation's problems peacefully by political means,
Whereas on 24 April 1991, the process of direct negotiation began between the Government of the Republic of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG), the Parties having pledged that the political agreements reached would reflect the legitimate aspirations of all Guatemalans and would be drawn up in accordance with the constitutional framework in force and with the El Escorial agreements, in which URNG and the country's political parties had pledged to promote such reforms of the Political Constitution of the Republic as were necessary for the reconciliation of all Guatemalans, the ending of the internal armed conflict, the peaceful solution of the nation's problems by political means and full respect for and application of the law,

Page 1, I. CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS
... Whereas the above-mentioned reforms will contribute to political stability, the strengthening of civilian power and the agreed redefinition of the functions of the armed forces for the new era in the country's history which will begin with the signing of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace,

Page 1, I. CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS
... Whereas the above-mentioned reforms also systematize and develop the spirit and the letter of the commitments signed on institutional, political, economic, social and ethnic issues, on human rights and their strict observance and on efforts to combat impunity,

Page 2, A. Constitutional reforms contained in the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples
4. This Agreement provides for constitutional recognition of the identity of the Maya, Garifuna and Xinca peoples and, from that standpoint, of the need to define and characterize the Guatemalan State as being one of national unity and multi-ethnic, multicultural and multilingual in nature. It is not just a matter of recognizing the existence and identity of various ethnic groups, as article 66 of the Constitution currently does, but of recognizing that the very make-up of society, without prejudice to the unity of the nation and the State, is characterized in that way; this also entails recognizing the specific nature of indigenous people's spirituality as an essential component of their world view and of the transmission of their values, and granting official constitutional recognition to indigenous languages as one of the mainstays of national culture and as a vehicle for acquiring and transmitting indigenous people's world view, knowledge and cultural values.

Page 3, A. Constitutional reforms contained in the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Identity of the Maya, Official recognition of indigenous languages
7. Sponsor in the Congress of the Republic, in accordance with the conclusions of the Official Recognition Commission established under the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the necessary constitutional amendments arising out of the Commission's work.

Page 3, B. Constitutional reforms included in the Agreement on the  Strengthening of Civilian Power and on the Role of the  Armed Forces in a Democratic Society
10. Within the framework of the modernization of State institutions, the Agreement on the Strengthening of Civilian Power and on the Role of the Armed Forces in a Democratic Society provides for constitutional reforms with respect to the Congress of the Republic, the Judiciary, the functions of the President of the Republic, and the Guatemalan armed forces. The aim is not to propose case-by-case measures, but to reformulate the whole conception of State organs and institutions with a view to strengthening democracy in line with present-day constitutional trends.

Page 6, B. Constitutional reforms included in the Agreement on the  Strengthening of Civilian Power and on the Role of the  Armed Forces in a Democratic Society, Functions of the President of the Republic
24. With regard to the functions of the President of the Republic, it has been agreed to sponsor the inclusion of the following in article 183:
... ""To order these exceptional measures, the President of the Republic shall issue the corresponding agreement. The action of the armed forces shall be limited to such time and modalities as are strictly necessary and shall cease as soon as its purpose has been achieved. The President of the Republic shall keep the Congress informed of the operations of the armed forces, and the Congress may at any time order that such operations shall cease. In any event, within 15 days following the end of such operations, the President of the Republic shall submit to the Congress a detailed report on the action of the armed forces.""

Page 7-8, II. ELECTORAL REGIME
Whereas:
... The level of electoral participation is the result of many different social and political factors, including the impact of civil institutions on the daily lives of Guatemalans, the capacity of political parties to fulfil people's expectations, the degree of organized participation by citizens in social and political life and their level of civic education, all of which are elements which the package of peace agreements already signed seeks to strengthen.
... This Agreement seeks to promote legal and institutional reforms which will remedy those shortcomings and constraints and, together with the other peace agreements, help to improve the electoral regime as an instrument of democratic transformation.

Page 8, II. ELECTORAL REGIME, Electoral Reform Commission
3. It is recommended that the above Commission be constituted no later than three months after the signing of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace and that it complete its work no later than six months from the date of its establishment. In order to achieve its objectives, the Commission would have to encourage an extensive pluralistic debate on the subject of Guatemala's electoral regime.

Page 11, II. ELECTORAL REGIME, Public information campaigns
19. In order to ensure that these campaigns are effective, account would have to be taken of the importance of using the various languages of indigenous peoples, as agreed in the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

In order to achieve the objectives set out in the Esquipulas II Agreement of 7 August 1987 and to put an end to the internal armed conflict and bring about reconciliation among all Guatemalans, in accordance with the Oslo Agreement of 30 March 1990, the delegations of the Government of Guatemala and of the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) hereby agree to hold talks in the presence of the Chairman of Guatemala's National Reconciliation Commission, Monsignor Rodolfo Quesada Torufio, acting as Conciliator pursuant to the Oslo Agreement, and of the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Francesc Vendrell, acting as Observer.

Page 2,
1. The Government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) undertake to conduct a process of negotiation that will permit, in the shortest possible time, the signing of an agreement for a firm and lasting peace which sets out political agreements, how they are to be implemented and executed by the parties, and how their fulfilment is to be verified by the National Reconciliation Commission, the United Nations and such other international bodies as the parties may designate by mutual agreement.

Page 2,
4. The Government and URNG undertake to be duly represented in the negotiations by high-level delegates, in order to negotiate and conclude political agreements in accordance with the existing constitutional framework and with the El Escorial agreements.

Page 3,
5. The Conciliator, in his capacity as Chairman of the National Reconciliation Commission, may if he thinks fit call together the various sectors that participated in the meetings with URNO held during 1990 under the Oslo Agreement, so as to inform them of the progress of the negotiations in the search for a firm and lasting peace and a solution to the nation's problems.

Page 3,
6. The Government of the Republic of Guatemala and URNG agree not to abandon the negotiating process unilaterally and to pursue it without interruption, in accordance with these procedural rules, until the negotiating agenda is exhausted. They undertake to act in good faith in an atmosphere of complete mutual respect and reiterate their express determination to reach political agreements for achieving a firm and lasting peace that will bring the internal armed conflict in Guatemala to an early, definitive end.

Page 3,
8. The Conciliator, Monsignor Rodolfo Quesada Toruio, in his capacity as Chairman of the National Reconciliation Commission, shall conduct meetings in accordance with the usual standards of debate. No recordings shall be made of the meeting, nor shall minutes be taken. Any agreements reached shall he formalised in documents discussed and approved by the parties and shall be signed by the Conciliator, the Observer, the delegates of the parties, and the members of the National Reconciliation Commission.

Page 3,
9. Under the Oslo Agreement, it is the function of the Conciliator to propose initiatives to the parties and to facilitate and sustain dialogue and negotiation, imparting momentum to that process and summarising points of agreement and disagreement between the parties. To that end, he has the power to propose initiatives and solutions for discussion and agreement and may do whatever else is necessary to the proper fulfilment of his mission. In addition to any other powers conferred on him in other sections of this document, the Conciliator shall: (a) convene the agreed meetings; (b) act as depositary for any documents that may result from the negotiation and provide certified copies thereof to the parties; (c) designate his advisers) and (d) order adjournments of the meetings.",GTM,,90.0,,233.0,1083,,809,No,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1

Spencer, representative of the International Negotiations Network (INN).","Page 1, OUTCOME OF DELIBERATIONS, Developments since the Committee's last meeting, 4: The Committee reviewed developments relating to the Liberian crisis since its last meeting in Yamoussoukro on 16 and 17 September 1991. The Committee noted with appreciation that since that meeting, the Republic of Senegal, in keeping with its promise to contribute troops to ECOMOG, had started deploying its troops to Liberia to join ECOMOG. It also noted with pleasure the fact that the parties, in consonance with the agreement reached in Yamoussoukro during the last meeting of the Committee of Five, had nominated a five-member Elections Commission for the organization and supervision of the elections to be held in Liberia, and a five-member ad hoc Supreme Court to adjudicate disputes that may arise from the electoral process, as provided for by the Liberian Constitution. The Committee urged the parties concerned to take all necessary action to ensure that the Interim Elections Commission begins its work without any further delay.

Page 2, OUTCOME OF DELIBERATIONS, Timetable for encampment and disarmament, 6: Recalling the earlier Yamoussoukro Accord of the parties to implement, under ECOMOG supervision, the encampment of their troops in designated locations and their disarmament, and the mandate given to ECOMOG, in liaison with the parties concerned, to work out the practical modalities for the implementation of that Accord, the Meeting considered and agreed a programme of implementation of these important elements of the cease-fire, which is annexed hereto (see enclosure below). This programme envisages the implementation within 60 days of all the modalities for the establishment of the necessary conditions of peace and security on the ground in order to reinforce the confidence of the parties as well as create a proper atmosphere conducive to the holding of free, fair and democratic elections in Liberia not later than six months from the date of this Meeting. The Committee therefore renewed its mandate to ECOMOG to ensure that the programme is smoothly and speedily implemented, in order to make it possible for democratic elections to be held in Liberia within the stipulated period. To this end, it appealed to all the parties concerned to continue to repose trust and confidence in ECOMOG and to cooperate fully with ECOMOG, the Interim Elections Commission, the INN and all other international observers who may wish to observe and monitor the electoral process.

Page 4, Enclosure, Programme of implementation, Tasks: It is clear that trust and confidence from all the parties to the conflict underpin the operations of ECOMOG which, in the light of the Yamoussoukro meetings, should now take us into the next phase. It is therefore recommended that this next phase commence on 15 November 1991, which shall be known as ""D"" Day.",LBR,,450.0,,341.0,1062,,860,No,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

The General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina initialled at Dayton, Ohio, United States of America, on 21 November 1995 by the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (see A/50/790-S/1995/999) provides the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the opportunity to rebuild their lives together in peace and prosperity...

Page 1, 2. 
The Peace Agreement will be signed at the Paris Conference on 14 December 1995. That Conference will mark a further important stage in bringing about recognition between the States in the region and will initiate promotion of good neighbourly relations between them.

Page 1, 3. 
The purpose of the London Peace Implementation Conference is to mobilize the international community behind a new start for the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Conference agrees that the peace should result in:...(h) Successful implementation of the Basic Agreement on the region of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium;

Page 2-3, Military implementation 8.
The military mission was described as having the following primary tasks: (a) To ensure continued compliance with the Cessation-of-Hostilities Agreement;

Page 3, Military implementation, 9. 
General Joulwan said that, in addition to these key tasks, IFOR might be asked to undertake the following supporting tasks within the limits of its capabilities: (a) To help create secure conditions for the conduct by others of other tasks associated with the Peace Agreement (though IFOR would not undertake humanitarian tasks itself);

Page 3, Regional stabilization, 12. 
The Conference therefore strongly: (a) Urges the parties to observe the deadlines set out in the Peace Agreement for agreeing on such measures;

Page 4, Civilian implementation, 14. 
Mr. Bildt identified in particular the need for early action in Sarajevo to create confidence between the communities. Bosnia and Herzegovina has requested the cooperation of the High Representative in the project of a unified Sarajevo as the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina as called for by the Peace Agreement...

Page 4, High Representative, 18. 
Following consultation with the Government of Bosnia the Conference approved the designation of Mr. Carl Bildt as High Representative and expressed gratitude for his willingness to take on this responsibility. It notes that Mr. Bildt will continue to act as EU Mediator for Former Yugoslavia and in that capacity will work closely with the EU Troika. The Conference invites the United Nations Security Council to agree to Mr. Bildt’s designation as High Representative.

Page 5, Administrative structures for civilian implementation, 20. 
The Conference concludes that, with the signature of the Peace Agreement, important objectives of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia have been met and a new structure is required to manage peace implementation.

Page 6, Humanitarian assistance, refugees and prisoners, 23. 
The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina has involved great suffering among the civilian population. Over 2.1 million people have been displaced or become refugees. The Conference acknowledges the great contribution made during the conflict by UNHCR and other humanitarian agencies, funded in large part by EU, as well as the support given in the countries of asylum. It agrees that an early objective of the Peace Agreement is to create secure conditions for the safe and orderly return of refugees and displaced persons to places of their choice.

Page 7, Humanitarian assistance, refugees and prisoners, 25.
The President of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) drew attention to the Committee’s tasks in respect of prisoners and missing persons. Fulfilment of the Peace Agreement will require: ...(b) Full cooperation of the parties over the release of prisoners and the provision of information about the fate of persons unaccounted for, as set out in the Peace Agreement.

Page 7, Humanitarian assistance, refugees and prisoners, 27. 
The parties undertake to comply urgently and fully with their obligations in creating the conditions necessary for the early, safe and orderly return of refugees and to cooperate fully with ICRC to ensure the early release of prisoners in accordance with the Peace Agreement.

Page 7, Protection of human rights, 30. 
The Conference takes note of the commitments made by the parties in the Peace Agreement...

Page 8, Protection of human rights, 31. 
The Conference underlines the relationship between the fulfilment by the parties of their commitments in the Peace Agreement, including the observance of the highest standards of human rights and the readiness of the international community to commit financial resources for reconstruction and development.

Page 8, Protection of human rights, 32. 
The Conference decides that, in view of the human rights situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, urgent action is needed in the following areas:...(c) OSCE should appoint an ombudsman, as provided for in the Peace Agreement; (d) The relevant Council of Europe organs should appoint members of the constitutional court for Bosnia and Herzegovina and the human rights chamber, as provided for in the Peace Agreement;

Page 8, Protection of human rights, 33. 
The Conference agrees that the High Representative or his representative will chair a human rights task force in Sarajevo, bringing together the organizations and agencies involved in the implementation of the Peace Agreement.

Page 8, Elections, 34. 
The Conference notes that, between six and nine months after signature of the Peace Agreement, elections supervised by a provisional election commission established by OSCE will be held in Bosnia and Herzegovina. These elections are of paramount importance in bringing about a democratic and stable country.

Page 11, Eastern Slavonia, 46. 
An informal meeting involving a number of delegations closely concerned was held in the margins of the Conference to discuss the implementation of the Basic Agreement on the region of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium.

Page 11, Eastern Slavonia, 47. 
There was recognition of the crucial importance of successful implementation of this Agreement. The international community will play its part. The United Nations Secretary-General will issue a report by 14 December. The United States of America declared its readiness to nominate a candidate to head the Transitional Administration, which will govern the region during the transitional period for which the Basic Agreement provides. It was agreed that no effort should be spared to find and deploy quickly adequate international forces required for the transitional period.",BIH,,346.0,,389.0,,,215,No,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,2,1,0,0,1,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,1

The London conference welcomes the steps taken by the international community to implement United Nations Security council Resolutions 713 and 757 imposing mandatory sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, but regrets that there remain gaps in implementation. The following proposals deal with the gaps identified so far.

Page 1, Compliance with UNSCR 757: need for enforcement, 2. 
The Conference notes that many countries are cooperating with the UN Sanctions Committee but is concerned that compliance remains incomplete. The Conference calls on all governments forthwith to comply fully with the requirements of UNSCR 757. All governments should respond to the appeal issued by the UN Sanctions Committee for information regarding violations of the sanctions regime.

Page 1, Compliance with UNSCR 757: need for enforcement, 3.
The Conference recommends that the Security Council should consider any requests made to it under Article 50 of the UN Charter by any state which considers that it is confronted by special economic problems arising from carrying out the requirements of UNSCR 757.

Page 2, The Danube, 5.
The Conference notes that Article 103 of the UN Charter obliges the riparian states of the Danube to do whatever is necessary, including the stopping and searching of vessels, to prevent the use of the River Danube for the purposes of circumventing or breaking the sanctions imposed in UNSCR Resolutions 713 and 757, notwithstanding the provisions of the Belgrade Convention.

Page 2, Unauthorised transfers of Serbian and Montenegrin assets, 7. 
The Conference is concerned that financial transfers for the benefit of Serbia and Montenegro in breach of UNSCR 757 are taking place. The Conference countries reaffirm their commitment to prevent such transfers and call on other states to do the same. The conference invites the UN  Sanctions Committee to consider whether its guidelines need to be tightened for this purpose.

Page 2, Strengthening the legal framework, 9.

The economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council against Serbia and Montenegro must be rigorously enforced by all members of the UN until the necessary conditions set out in Security Council Resolution 820, including the withdrawal of Bosnian Serb troops from territories occupied by force, are met for lifting the sanctions.

Sealing borders. We note the pledge of the Belgrade authorities to close the border with Bosnia-Herzegovina, in order to put pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Peace Plan. We are watching to see if the border closure is effective. Although the primary responsibility for enforcing this step belongs to Belgrade, we can assist, for instance by placing monitors on the borders or providing technical expertise or conducting aerial surveillance. We also note the willingness expressed by the Zagreb authorities for monitoring to take place along the border between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Durable peace. Negotiated settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina, building on the Vance-Owen process and intensified international cooperation and effort, is the way a durable peace can be established.

We reiterate our strong commitment to the speedy implementation and full functioning of the Federation and all its institutions. We reaffirm our commitment to the Dayton Agreement on Implementing the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina of 10 November 1995 and to the obligations of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina of 14 December 1995. We confirm our support for the Rome Statement of 18 February 1996, the Geneva Statement of 18 March 1996 and the Sarajevo Agreement on the Federation of 30 March 1996. We commit ourselves to the full and rapid implementation of those provisions of the Sarajevo Agreement that have not yet been fulfilled.

Page 2, 7. 
We reiterate our commitment with regard to the provisions of the Peace Agreement that all refugees and displaced persons have the right to return to their homes in the whole territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina with full protection of their human and other rights.

Page 2, Federation implementation, 9. 
We reaffirm the commitment under the Rome Statement on Sarajevo of 18 February 1996 that there will be equal treatment and non-discrimination for Bosniacs, Croats, Serbs and Others in Sarajevo. This includes, in line with paragraph 7 above, the right of return for refugees and displaced persons of all peoples that left Sarajevo and the full protection of their human and other rights. It also means that all these peoples will have the opportunity to participate fully in the governance of the city. The Joint Civilian Commission Sarajevo will continue to function, as stipulated in the Rome Statement, as a consultative and coordinating body for this purpose.

After consideration of the implementation of previous agreements on the Federation, we stress the importance of realizing the provisions on media contained in the Petersberg Agreement of 10 March 1995.

I take this opportunity to remind you that we still have not concluded the task started in Dayton, Ohio of interpreting certain regulations contained in the Transit Agreement for Peace Plan Operations between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and NATO, signed on 21 and 23 November 1995. On 20 February 1996, we received a letter from Mr. B. de Vidts, Legal Adviser of NATO, which contained some interpretations of the provisions of the Transit Agreement, but these interpretations greatly departed from those agreed upon in Dayton. Pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Transit Agreement is subject to the approval by the Federal Assembly. Pending the approval, it is implemented on a temporary basis. In my previous letters I explained to you that your confirmation as to the meaning of certain regulations contained in the Transit Agreement, set forth in Dayton, would be of great importance in the procedure of granting the approval to the Transit Agreement by the Federal Assembly. In his letter of 30 April 1996, General George Joulwan (SACEUR) informed me that the matter would be reviewed by the competent officials and that I would shortly be informed thereof. Since I have not received any reply so far, I kindly ask you to intercede so that the competent NATO authorities may confirm in a letter the interpretation of the Transit Agreement agreed upon in Dayton. I am sending you, enclosed herewith, a copy of the text ""Understandings Regarding Certain Provisions of the Agreement Between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Concerning Transit Arrangements for Peace Plan Operations"", set forth in Dayton...

The Republic of Croatia, as a co-signatory of the Dayton/Paris Agreement, has been supporting the implementation of its provisions throughout the previous period in the interest of stability and security in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the role of IFOR in carrying out the military measures designed to ensure peace. Not only Croatia but also the international community as a whole is interested in a continued process of unreserved implementation of the accords reached.

Protocol of Peace, Friendship and Borders of Rio de Janeiro

Page 1, Par. 2:
As Guarantor Countries, we must recognize that the parties, on the basis of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol and in line with the Itamaraty Peace Declaration and other documents that it produces, have sought to achieve peace, friendship and understanding that would enable them to develop a cooperative relationship of mutual benefit that fulfils the goals referred to in Article 1 of said Protocol. 

Page 1, Par.3:
We also gladly note that this process has to date enabled plans for a Trade and Navigation Treaty, for Navigation in the Gaps in Rivers and in the Napo River, for a Comprehensive Border Integration Agreement, and for the constitution of a Binational Commission on Mutual Trust and Safety Measures, as well as for an agreement for establishing measures to ensure the effective functioning of the Zarumilla Channel. 

Page 1, Par. 4:
Your Government has, together with the Government of Ecuador, conveyed to us its concern for having tried, throughout this long process and without achieving results that meet the expectations of both populations, to cover all aspects, as described by the Brasilia Declaration of November 26th, 1997, and the Rio de Janeiro Timetable on January 19th of the current year. As Your Excellency mentioned in the letter that was jointly sent with the President of Ecuador on the 8th of this month (October) to the President of Brazil, the difficulties encountered have to do with setting a Common Land Border in the area. 

Page 2, Par. 1: 
Accordingly, having complied with these requirements, we, Heads of State of the Guarantor Countries, in line with the Santiago Agreement and the Rio de Janeiro Timetable, express our point of view (which the parties accept as being of a binding nature), that contains the following elements to complete the establishment of a Common Land Border in the area and complement the comprehensive and definitive agreement

Page 2, Art.1:
1. In light of disagreement between the parties on  the views and opinions issued by the experts appointed by the Guarantor Countries, in line with the Brasilia Declaration timetable on the three items submitted for consideration, the Guarantor Countries of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol believe that such views are part of the implementation of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol and under the judgment of the Arbitrator Braz Dias de Aguiar, and that the parties must therefore proceed to finalize these borders in the manner established by these views and opinions. For this purpose, the annexed maps specify the coordinates of the landmarks to be erected

Page 3, Art.11:
11. Additionally, the parties will proceed to formalize projects put in place by the treaties and agreements, the texts of which are part of the comprehensive and definitive agreement that will put an end to the differences between the two countries. Moreover, we have the pleasure to inform you that, as stated in our communication of October 10th, this operation has been brought to the knowledge of His Holiness Pope John Paul II, who is pleased for this noble compromise and prays that the present agreement is the basis of a lasting coexistence in peace and prosperity of the fraternal people of Peru and Ecuador. 

Page 3, final paragraph:
The Guarantor Countries consider that the process born from the Peace Declaration of Itaramaty will be completed while respecting the interests and feelings of the two nations and ensuring the full and faithful implementation of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol. In this way, aspirations of peace, friendship and belief in a common future that the people of Peru and Ecuador seek may develop.",ECU,PER,130.0,135.0,403.0,,,217,No,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1

In connection with the renewal of the conflicts between the two armies (the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croatian Defence Council) in central Bosnia and some other parts of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which have caused many casualties and serious violations of international humanitarian law, thus posing the threat of far-reaching political consequences, the signatories of this Joint Statement hereby order all military units of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) to immediately cease fire and all hostilities in all areas where such military units are in contact.

Page 1, 3. 
The signatories of this Joint Statement urge all commanders and units of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) to unconditionally respect all the thus far concluded agreements between the representatives of the Croatian and Muslim peoples in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In particular, they urge military units of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Croatian Defence Council to immediately start implementing the Agreement on the legality of both the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the HVO, and on the establishment of a joint command of both forces made up of representatives of both headquarters (enclosure).

Page 3, Endorsement of ECOWAS peace plan, 7: The Authority noted with satisfaction that the ECOWAS peace plan had received the widest acceptance and support from Liberians and the international community.

Page 3, Signing of the cease-fire agreement, 8: In giving practical effect to this ECOWAS peace plan for Liberia, the Authority stressed the urgent need for a comprehensive cease-fire to be observed by all the warring parties as a necessary condition for the return of peace and normalcy throughout the territory of Liberia. The Authority therefore warmly commended the two warring parties - the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) and the Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia (INPFL) - who had agreed to observe a cease-fire and had signed a cease-fire agreement at Banjul on 24 October 1990,

Page 3, Signing of the cease-fire agreement, 9: At the Extraordinary Session of the Authority at Bamako, the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPLF) - the third party to the conflict in Liberia - expressed its readiness to join in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict. The Authority noted with pleasure the acceptance by the NPLF and the other warring parties not only of the ECOWAS peace plan for Liberia as embodied in the communique and decisions of 7 August 1990 of the Community Standing Mediation Committee, but also their declaration of a cease-fire, which shall come into effect immediately. The Authority urged that the details for the implementation of the cease-fire should be worked out as soon as possible. It expressed the sincere hope that this declaration of cease-fire would mark the complete cessation of all hostilities as the necessary foundation for the return of lasting peace, stability and political accommodation and reconciliation of Liberia.

Page 4, Collective responsibility for ECOMOG, 11: The Authority also considered the necessity for an agreement to be concluded between ECOWAS and the Interim Government of Liberia with respect to the status and operations of the Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) in Liberia. To this end, the Authority mandated the Executive Secretary to sign an agreement with the Interim Government of Liberia after approval by the Chairman of the Authority.

Page 4, Agreement on interim governance of Liberia, 12: The Authority urgently invited the parties to the conflict in Liberia to enter into dialogue with a view to reaching a political accommodation for the governance of Liberia within the framework of the ECOWAS peace plan. The Authority requested the Standing Mediation Committee to continue its efforts in encouraging such an accommodation between the Liberian groups.

Page 4, Reaffirmation of the Protocol on Non-Aggression, 14. Recalling that it had itself fully recognized the necessity for maintaining the peace and security of the subregion early in the life of the Community through the Protocol on Non-Aggression adopted on 22 April 1978, and believing that the Liberian crisis has given that Protocol a fresh validity, the Authority decided to reaffirm the provisions of the Protocol on Non-Aggression and to urge all member States to adhere fully to their obligations under it. In particular, the Authority recalled the commitment by all member States to refrain from committing, encouraging or condoning acts of subversion, hostility or aggression against any other member State. It further called on all member States to refrain from any action that might prejudice or undermine the smooth and speedy implementation of the ECOWAS peace plan for Liberia.",LBR,,450.0,,341.0,,,860,No,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1

Today, the governments of the United Kingdom, Norway and the United States (the Troika) signed the Juba Peace Agreement as Witnesses in a signal of political support to the Agreement. Having welcomed the Agreement in October 2020, this further step demonstrates our commitment to the success of the Agreement and its potential to help meet the calls of the Sudanese people for freedom, peace, and justice, including for those affected by conflict in Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile states, as well as other historically marginalised parts of Sudan. We urge immediate steps to fully implement and adhere to the agreed timelines set forth in the transitional Constitutional Document and the Juba Peace Agreement, including the formation of key institutions such as the Transitional Legislative Council.

Page 2, Troika statement from the UK, Norway and USA:
... UNITAMS plays a key role in supporting implementation of the Juba Peace Agreement.

Page 2, Troika statement from the UK, Norway and USA:
... The Troika also welcomes the agreement on a Declaration of Principles between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North/Abdelaziz alHilu and encourages both sides to reach agreement on ending their conflict so all Sudanese can play a part in the transitional process.

Page 2, Troika statement from the UK, Norway and USA:
We also continue to make our call for the Sudan Liberation Movement/ Abdulwahid al-Nur to begin talks as part of achieving a comprehensive peace involving all major armed movements. The Government of Sudan has described the Juba Peace Agreement as ‘Phase One’ of the peace process and the negotiations with al-Hilu and al-Nur as ‘Phase Two’. The Troika consider the implementation of the Juba Peace Agreement and the simultaneous ‘Phase Two’ negotiations to be of equal importance and we believe the success of Sudan’s transitional period rests on finding unity in diversity based on equal rights and building sustainable development through inclusive policies...",SDN,,625.0,,309.0,,,,No,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
