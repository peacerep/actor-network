It includes a declaration, and two roadmaps for the transition. In the document, the duties of the transitional government and the National Transitional Council (CNT) are listed. Most importantly, the CNT is to act as a body tasked with drafting constitutional and legislative texts, and its composition is to expand so that it may be more representative and inclusive of groups still fighting, civil society, and women. The declaration sets an 18 month transitional period, during which elections are to be held.",

There is also provision for resources to support the protection mechanisms, to be provided by the government and the group of accompanying support and cooperation countries (GPAAC).",
