    "description":"This agreement comprises a series of in-essence 6 different agreements which provide for agreement between the Transitional Government of Sudan (TGOS)and different areas, on different but interconnected peace process 'tracks'.  These comprise a Darfur Agreement between the TGOS and 'Darfur Parties to Peace' (Title 2); a 'Two Areas' agreements between TGOS and the The Sudan People's Liberation Movement - North \/ The Revolutionary Front (Title 3); the Eastern Sudan Track Agreement between the TGOS and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (Title 4); Track 5, Agreement between the TGOS and the Sudan Revolutionary Front - Northern Track (Title 5); Agreement of the Central Track between the TSGO and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (Title 6); and Security arrangements between the TSGO and the Third-Front - Tamazuj (Title 7).  While the agreements are all varied, they provide on the most part for some representation of these areas in the transitional government and\/or wider institutional structures of the transition, and for new governance and security and economic \/ development provision within each area.  The Agreement therefore in its totality in a sense connects the wider armed conflict with different groups, or different factions or branches of the same broad group, with the transition process focused on the move from military rule at the level of the central state, and with the Transitional government (itself a mixed military-civilian government).    \r\n\r\nPlease note that the coding below reflects the key provisions for each category. For several categories (such as Refugees\/displaced persons, DDR, material reparations, development, territorial powersharing, ceasefire, women\/gender and others) the relevant provisions did not fit into the database format.

These comprise a Darfur Agreement between the TGOS and 'Darfur Parties to Peace' (Title 2); a 'Two Areas' agreements between TGOS and the The Sudan People's Liberation Movement - North \/ The Revolutionary Front (Title 3); the Eastern Sudan Track Agreement between the TGOS and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (Title 4); Track 5, Agreement between the TGOS and the Sudan Revolutionary Front - Northern Track (Title 5); Agreement of the Central Track between the TSGO and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (Title 6); and Security arrangements between the TSGO and the Third-Front - Tamazuj (Title 7).  While the agreements are all varied, they provide on the most part for some representation of these areas in the transitional government and\/or wider institutional structures of the transition, and for new governance and security and economic \/ development provision within each area.  The Agreement therefore in its totality in a sense connects the wider armed conflict with different groups, or different factions or branches of the same broad group, with the transition process focused on the move from military rule at the level of the central state, and with the Transitional government (itself a mixed military-civilian government).    \r\n\r\nPlease note that the coding below reflects the key provisions for each category. For several categories (such as Refugees\/displaced persons, DDR, material reparations, development, territorial powersharing, ceasefire, women\/gender and others) the relevant provisions did not fit into the database format.
