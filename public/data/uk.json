The agreement states the witnessing role is a signal of political support. The agreement puts in place modalities for implementation that link to the main Juba agreement of October 2020. The text addresses adherence by parties to fully implement the agreed Juba timeline in forming key political institutions including the Transitional Legislative Council and calls for increased efforts to establish ceasefire monitoring mechanisms. Substantively the agreement also calls the parties to the Juba agreement to be accountable regarding protection of civilians with a focus on addressing gender-based violence and conflict related sexual violence, calling for further strengthening of the rule of law.
