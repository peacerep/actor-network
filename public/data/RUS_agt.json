In an attempt to take advantage of this change, US Secretary of State James Baker made eight trips to the region in the eight months following the Gulf War. The Madrid Invitation, inviting Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinians to an opening conference represents the result of this shuttle diplomacy. The invitation, an outcome of compromises by all sides, details the structure of the Madrid process: \r\n\r\nAn opening conference having no power to impose solutions \r\nBilateral talks with the Arab states bordering Israel, \r\nTalks with the Palestinians on 5-year interim self-rule, to be followed by talks on the permanent status \r\nMultilateral talks on key regional issues, like refugees. \r\nThe following is the complete text of the invitation to the Madrid Peace Conference on October 30, 1991, jointly issued by the U.S. and the Soviet Union: The co-sponsors believe that those negotiations should focus on region-wide issues of water, refugee issues, environment, economic development, and other subjects of mutual interest.",
